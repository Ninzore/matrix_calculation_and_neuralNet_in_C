# matrix_calculation_in_C
do matrix calculations with plain C, and even more

## Please see the example.c for instuctions

##  Matrix calculation Now support
1. create a matrix, can be initialised by a 1D array
2. create a matrix, with all the members equal to one number
3. create an identity matrix
4. create a random matrix, can set the random range
5. create a random matrix with values follow Gaussian distribution
6. convert matrix to 1D array
7. print matrix
8. matrix transformation
9. transfer all the members in a matrix to exponential form
10. add a number to all members in a matrix
11. minus a number from all members in a matrix
12. matrix addition
13. matrix substraction
14. multiply with a scalar
15. array multiplication (star multiply * in numpy)
16. inner product
17. dot product
18. to do: inverse matrix
19. to do: cross product
